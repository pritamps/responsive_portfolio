This is just me following through on a [YouTube Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbYoGoCjKoMOkVznV6aSXKzU) by a very nice and efficient instructor to learn the basics of using SASS.

Along with SASS, I learned some modern design techniques, animation, and all that while solidifying my skills in HTML5, CSS3 (including Grid and Flexbox) and vanilla Javascript.

My notes (just a list of points) can be found [here](notes.md)
